# react-and-morty

React and morty features the characters from the television show _Rick and Morty_. On button click additional information can be displayed and the corresponding characters can be bookmarked.

**Link to project:** https://react-and-morty-theta.vercel.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

To fetch the data from the API the useEffect-Hook is being used. The data is then rendered in a seperate card component. In that some Information ist hidden at first so that it can be displayed with the button click. This is handled by using the useState hook.

## Lessons Learned:

The goal was to practice retrieving api's and rendering the results. The project is rather small in the process. The biggest learning was how to use the useEffect hook. In this context, I also learned more about how side effects work in React.
